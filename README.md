# PrixDB

An Open-Source GraphQL API providing formula 1 grand prix and standings data as soon as they become available.

Data provided by courtesy of [F1DB](https://github.com/f1db/f1db). This project would literally not be possible without the work they are doing and I am simply providing an easier way for people to have access to the data they have collated.
